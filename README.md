# AI_Models_Exoplanet_Detection

## This project is for entry of simsef and csef

The detection of exoplanets remains a dynamic and rapidly evolving field within the astronomical community. As data from space telescopes and ground-based observatories continue to grow, machine learning techniques have become indispensable for automating data mining and analysis. This study investigates the application of several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), for exoplanet detection. Using a synthetic transit light dataset, we train and evaluate these models, comparing their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning to enhance exoplanet detection and provide valuable insights into the strengths of various algorithms in processing large-scale astronomical datasets from real missions such as Kelpler and SDSS.
